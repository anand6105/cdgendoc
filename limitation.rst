Limitations and Extensions

Limitations and constraints
----------------------------
*	An Amalthea model with Software, Hardware, Stimuli, Mapping model, Operating System Model is inevitable for the codegeneration.
*	Allocation of the tasks to core(s) are performed based on the mapping model. 
*	The Operating System Model are needed to get the executable cores but the scheduler will be based on the User choice.

Extensions
--------------------
*	Implementation of additional Scheduling Algorithms.
*	Addition of support for further Hardware platforms.
*	Automated User Interface Test based on the Eclipse RCP Testing Tool.
* 	Label management based on the mapping model to give more space for memory management analysis.
